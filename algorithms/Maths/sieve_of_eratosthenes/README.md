# Sieve of Eratosthenes

The sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all primes smaller than n when n is smaller than 10 million.The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n*Log(Log(n))).

### Input Format

- The input consists of a single line.
- There will be a single integer **N**.

### Output Format

- A list of prime numbers less than equal to N.

### Sample Input

```
10
```

### Sample Output

```
Following are the prime numbers less than equal to 10
2 3 5 7
```

### Implemented in:

- [Java](SieveOfEratosthenes.java)
